            position: "President - Middle East and North Africa",
            bio: "Sir Abdallah Mohammed Narabi - From \"Born Not to Make It\" to Leading a Continental Vision Sir Abdallah Mohammed Narabi‚Äîa Nigerian-born entrepreneur, export strategist, and visionary‚Äîis the embodiment of what it means to rise above circumstance and redefine national identity through global impact. His journey from hardship to high honor has not only built billion-naira ventures but now culminates in a historic nomination: President of the Nigerians in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Community. From Humble Beginnings to Global Recognition Born on August 19, 1979, in Jos North, Plateau State, Abdallah lost his father at just 16, shouldering the responsibility of his family alongside his widowed mother. Forced into business by necessity at 19, he began building grit, insight, and strategy from the streets‚Äînot from a safety net. While others sought comfort, he sought knowledge, inspired by global business minds like Perry S. Marshall and Myron Golden. He pursued a Higher National Diploma at NACABS Polytechnic, Nassarawa State, but credits the marketplace‚Äîand the rejection-filled road to success‚Äîas his true education. A Vision Beyond Survival Turning away from a salaried position at the Jos Electricity Distribution Company with no savings, but a clear vision, Abdallah founded Rated Rolling Rabworld Nigeria Ltd and Easy Sales Export Nigeria Limited. These businesses became launchpads for redefining Nigeria's position in global trade. His achievements include: ‚Ä¢ Building a ‚Ç¶15 million business from ‚Ç¶1,900 in just two months. ‚Ä¢ Turning ‚Ç¶25,000 into ‚Ç¶30 million in three months. ‚Ä¢ Using ‚Ç¶75,000 to generate over a billion-naira export transaction in one year. These feats are not myths‚Äîthey are documented, audited, and replicated success stories that have inspired a movement. Driving National and Regional Transformation What sets Sir Abdallah apart‚Äîand what earned him this nomination‚Äîis not just his business acumen, but his national service through enterprise. He has developed training platforms and consortium models that have empowered thousands of Nigerians, particularly youth and women, to break into the global market with local products. His mission is bold and actionable: ‚Ä¢ Replace Nigeria's dependency on imports with a vibrant export culture. ‚Ä¢ Empower local farmers, artisans, and SMEs to earn foreign income. ‚Ä¢ Transform Nigeria's reputation in global trade‚Äîone success story at a time. This transformational work naturally extended to the Middle East and North Africa, where he built active networks and business frameworks that benefit Nigerians abroad‚Äîearning him regional respect and ultimately, this presidential nomination. Thought Leadership and Faith Sir Abdallah is the author of two powerful books: ‚Ä¢ Speed Selling 101: How to Sell Faster and Dominate Your Market ‚Ä¢ 7 Things You Need to Know About Export His work spans Africa and the Middle East, with a growing footprint in diaspora communities. Anchored by his deep Islamic faith, he sees his journey not as a pursuit of fame, but a divine mandate to serve, uplift, and reform. Why the MENA Presidency Nomination Matters His nomination as President of Nigerians in the MENA Community is not simply a personal milestone‚Äîit is a reflection of his lifelong commitment to the Nigerian people, wherever they reside. His leadership is seen as a bridge between the home country and the diaspora, offering: ‚Ä¢ Economic empowerment programs ‚Ä¢ Cross-border trade platforms ‚Ä¢ Cultural and national pride restoration among Nigerians abroad In a world full of noise, Sir Abdallah has built a legacy of quiet consistency, ethical leadership, and unstoppable impact. He was born not to make it. Yet today, he leads where others only dreamed. Sir Abdallah Mohammed Narabi isn't just a success story‚Äî He is the reason others now believe they can write their own.",
